    <h1>Wheat Crop Information</h1>
    
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Wheat is typically seeded in the fall or spring, depending on the climate and variety. The seeds are sown in well-prepared soil at a depth of about 1-2 inches. Adequate spacing between the rows is essential for healthy growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>After seeding, wheat plants go through various growth stages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Germination:</strong> The seeds sprout, and the first root and shoot emerge.</li>
      <li><strong>Tillering:</strong> Multiple shoots develop from the base of the plant, forming additional stems.</li>
      <li><strong>Jointing:</strong> The stem elongates, and nodes become visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Boot stage:</strong> The head of the wheat plant is enclosed within the boot.</li>
      <li><strong>Heading:</strong> The head emerges from the boot, and the florets become visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Flowering:</strong> The wheat plant produces flowers that lead to grain formation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>The wheat crop is ready for harvest when the grains have ripened and turned golden brown. Harvesting methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Combining:</strong> The most common method where a combine harvester cuts the wheat stalks, threshes the grains, and collects them in a hopper.</li>
      <li><strong>Hand Harvesting:</strong> Used in some regions for small-scale production, where workers use sickles or scythes to cut the wheat manually.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Storage and Usage</h2>
    <p>After harvest, the wheat grains are stored in suitable containers or silos to protect them from moisture and pests. Wheat is a versatile crop and is used for various purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour production for bread, pasta, and other food products.</li>
      <li>Animal feed.</li>
      <li>Malting for beer and whiskey production.</li>
      <li>Wheat bran for animal feed or dietary supplements.</li>
    </ul>
