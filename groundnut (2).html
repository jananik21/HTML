    <h2>Groundnut Growing Process</h2>

    <h3>1. Seeding</h3>
    <p>
      Groundnut seeds are planted in well-prepared soil at a depth of about 2-3 inches.
      Adequate spacing is maintained between the seeds to allow room for growth.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Germination</h3>
    <p>
      After planting, the groundnut seeds start to germinate.
      They absorb water from the soil and sprout, forming seedlings.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Vegetative Growth</h3>
    <p>
      As the seedlings continue to grow, they develop leaves and stems.
      The plants require regular watering and adequate sunlight for healthy growth.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Flowering</h3>
    <p>
