    <h1>Medicinal plants growing process</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Start by planting the medicinal plant seeds in a suitable pot or garden bed. Ensure that the soil is well-drained and
      the seeds are sown at the appropriate depth. Water the seeds gently and place the pot or bed in a location that
      receives adequate sunlight.
    </p>

    <h2>Germination</h2>
    <p>
      After a few days or weeks, the seeds will start to germinate. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged during this
      stage. Once the seedlings have grown a few inches tall, it's time to transplant them to individual pots or space them
      out in the garden, maintaining proper spacing for each plant.
    </p>

    <h2>Growth and Care</h2>
    <p>
      As the medicinal plants continue to grow, provide them with regular watering, sunlight, and appropriate nutrients.
      Monitor the plants for pests and diseases, and take necessary steps to control them. Prune the plants if needed to
      promote bushier growth and remove any dead or yellowing leaves.
    </p>

    <h2>Flowering and Maturity</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the specific plant, it will eventually reach the flowering stage. Flowers are often a sign that the plant
      is maturing and nearing its harvest time. Observe the plant closely and follow any specific guidelines for optimal
      harvesting time.
    </p>

    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>
      When the medicinal plants are ready for harvesting, carefully cut or pluck the desired parts of the plant, such as
      leaves, flowers, or roots. Use sharp and clean tools to avoid damaging the plant. Handle the harvested parts gently to
      preserve their quality.
