    <h1>Barley Growing Process</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>1. Prepare the soil by tilling and removing weeds.</p>
    <p>2. Sow the barley seeds evenly across the prepared soil.</p>
    <p>3. Water the seeds adequately and ensure the soil remains moist.</p>
    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>4. Barley will begin to germinate within a week.</p>
    <p>5. As the plants grow, provide regular watering and ensure adequate sunlight.</p>
    <p>6. Watch for any signs of pests or diseases and take necessary measures.</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>7. Wait for the barley plants to reach maturity, usually around 90-120 days.</p>
    <p>8. Check the moisture content of the grains. It should be around 12-14% for harvesting.</p>
    <p>9. Cut the plants at the base and tie them into bundles.</p>
    <p>10. Hang the bundles upside down in a well-ventilated area to dry.</p>
