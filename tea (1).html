    <h1>Tea growing process</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Tea seeds are sown in well-prepared soil. They require a warm and humid environment to germinate.</p>
    
    <h2>Seedlings</h2>
    <p>After a few weeks, the tea seeds sprout and develop into seedlings. They are carefully nurtured in a shaded area to promote healthy growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Plantation</h2>
    <p>The seedlings are transplanted to the main tea plantation. They are spaced out to allow enough room for growth and proper air circulation.</p>
    
    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>The tea plants grow and develop new leaves. Regular pruning and maintenance are performed to ensure healthy growth and optimal leaf production.</p>
    
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>When the tea leaves reach maturity, they are carefully handpicked or machine-harvested. The timing of harvesting is crucial for the desired flavor and quality of the tea.</p>
    
    <h2>Processing</h2>
    <p>After harvesting, the tea leaves undergo various processing methods such as withering, rolling, oxidation, and drying. These steps determine the type and flavor of the tea.</p>
    
    <h2>Packaging</h2>
    <p>The processed tea is packaged and prepared for distribution. It may be sold as loose leaves or in tea bags, depending on the market demand.</p>
