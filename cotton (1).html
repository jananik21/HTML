    <h1>Growing Cotton: From Seeding to Harvesting</h1>
    <h2>1. Seeding</h2>
    <p>Seeding is the first step in growing cotton. Cotton seeds are planted in the soil, usually in rows, to provide enough space for the plants to grow.</p>

    <h2>2. Germination</h2>
    <p>After seeding, the cotton seeds begin to germinate. With the right conditions of moisture and warmth, the seeds sprout, and the plants start to emerge from the soil.</p>

    <h2>3. Vegetative Growth</h2>
    <p>During the vegetative growth stage, the cotton plants develop leaves and branches. They continue to grow taller and wider, establishing a strong root system.</p>

    <h2>4. Flowering</h2>
    <p>As the cotton plants mature, they start to produce flowers. These flowers are typically white or yellow and eventually develop into cotton bolls.</p>

    <h2>5. Boll Development</h2>
    <p>The cotton bolls contain the cotton fibers. Over time, the bolls grow larger and become filled with the fluffy white fibers that are harvested to produce cotton.</p>

    <h2>6. Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Once the cotton bolls have fully developed, it is time for harvesting. The cotton plants are picked or mechanically harvested to gather the cotton fibers.</p>
