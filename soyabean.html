    <h2>Soybean</h2>
    <div class="crop-info">
    <p>Soybean is a versatile crop grown for its edible seeds and oil content. It is widely cultivated around the world.</p>
    <p>Here is some information about the lifecycle of soybean:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seeding:</strong> Soybean seeds are sown in well-prepared soil during the appropriate planting season.</li>
      <p>
      <li><strong>Germination:</strong> The seeds absorb moisture and sprout, sending out roots and shoots.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The plant grows leaves, stems, and branches. It requires adequate sunlight, water, and nutrients.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Flowering:</strong> As the plant matures, it produces flowers. Soybean flowers are typically white or purple.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Pollination:</strong> Pollination occurs when bees or other pollinators transfer pollen from the male to the female flower parts.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Pod Development:</strong> After successful pollination, pods containing soybean seeds begin to form.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Maturation:</strong> The soybean pods mature and change color. The plant's leaves may start to turn yellow.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Once the soybean pods are fully mature, they are harvested using appropriate machinery or by hand.</li>
      <p></p>
