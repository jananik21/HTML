    <h1>Fruits growing proces</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>Start by planting the seeds in nutrient-rich soil. Ensure that the seeds are placed at the appropriate depth and water them regularly.</p>
   
  

  
    <h2>Sprouting</h2>
    <p>After a few weeks, the seeds will start to sprout, and you'll see small seedlings emerging from the soil.</p>
  
  

    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>The seedlings will continue to grow, developing leaves, stems, and roots. Make sure to provide adequate sunlight and water for healthy growth.</p>
  
 

 
    <h2>Step 4: Flowering</h2>
    <p>As the plants mature, they will produce flowers, which are necessary for pollination and fruit development.</p>
  
  


    <h2>Step 5: Fruit Formation</h2>
    <p>After successful pollination, the flowers will transform into fruits. Watch as the fruits grow and change in color and size.</p>
  
  

    <h2>Step 6: Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Once the fruits have ripened, carefully harvest them from the plants. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!</p>
