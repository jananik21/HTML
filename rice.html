    <h1>Rice growing process</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Rice cultivation begins with the seeding process. Rice seeds are usually soaked in water for a day or two to initiate germination. Then, the seeds are sown in prepared fields that are flooded with water to create a suitable growing environment for rice plants.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>
      Once the rice seeds have germinated, they develop into seedlings and eventually grow into mature rice plants. During this stage, the rice field is carefully maintained with adequate water levels, as rice requires a lot of water for proper growth. The plants also need fertilizers and protection from pests and diseases to ensure healthy development.
    </p>
    <h2>Flowering and Ripening</h2>
    <p>
      As the rice plants mature, they enter the flowering stage. The plants produce panicles that contain rice grains. After pollination, the grains develop and ripen. At this stage, the water in the field is gradually reduced to allow the grains to dry and harden.
    </p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>
      When the rice grains have reached the desired level of maturity and moisture content, it's time for harvesting. The plants are cut close to the ground and gathered into bundles. The harvested rice is then threshed to separate the grains from the rest of the plant. Threshing can be done manually or using mechanical equipment.
