    <h2>Forage Crop Growth</h2>
    <h3>Seeding</h3>
    <p>Seeding is the initial stage of forage crop growth. It involves planting seeds in prepared soil.</p>
    
    <h3>Germination</h3>
    <p>After seeding, the seeds absorb water and nutrients from the soil, leading to germination. Roots and shoots begin to develop.</p>
    
    <h3>Vegetative Growth</h3>
    <p>During this stage, the forage crop focuses on leaf and stem growth. It requires ample sunlight, water, and nutrients.</p>
    
    <h3>Flowering</h3>
    <p>When the plant reaches maturity, it produces flowers. These flowers are important for pollination and seed production.</p>
    
    <h3>Maturation</h3>
    <p>As the forage crop continues to grow, the seeds mature and develop
