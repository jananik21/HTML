    <h1>Maize growing process</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Maize cultivation begins with the seeding process. Maize seeds are sown in prepared fields at the right time of the year. The seeds are planted at a specific depth and spacing to ensure proper growth.
    </p>
    <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
    <p>
      After seeding, the maize plants start to grow and develop. They require regular watering, proper nutrition, and adequate sunlight to thrive. As the plants grow taller, they develop leaves, stalks, and ears of corn.
    </p>
    <h2>Pollination</h2>
    <p>
      Maize plants rely on pollination for the development of their kernels. The tassels, located at the top of the plants, release pollen that needs to reach the silks, which emerge from the ears. The process of pollination is crucial for successful kernel formation.
    </p>
    <h2>Ripening and Harvesting</h2>
    <p>
      As the maize kernels mature, the plants enter the ripening stage. The husks of the ears gradually turn brown and dry out. When the kernels are fully mature and dry, it's time for harvesting. The ears are picked by hand or using mechanical equipment.
