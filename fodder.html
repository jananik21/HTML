        <h2 class="crop-title">Seeding</h2>
        <p class="crop-description">Seeding is the first step in growing a fodder crop. Prepare the soil by removing weeds and rocks. Spread the seeds evenly across the field and cover them lightly with soil. Water the field regularly to ensure proper germination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="crop-section">
        <h2 class="crop-title">Germination</h2>
        <p class="crop-description">After seeding, the seeds will begin to germinate. Keep the soil moist and provide enough sunlight for the seeds to sprout. Germination usually takes about 7-14 days, depending on the crop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="crop-section">
        <h2 class="crop-title">Growth and Development</h2>
        <p class="crop-description">As the crop grows, make sure to water it regularly and provide necessary nutrients. Monitor the crop for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate measures to control them. The crop will continue to grow and develop over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="crop-section">
        <h2 class="crop-title">Harvesting</h2>
        <p class="crop-description">When the crop reaches the desired height, it is ready for harvesting. Cut the crop close to the ground using a sharp tool or machinery. Allow the harvested crop to dry in the sun for a few days before storing or using it as fodder.</p>
