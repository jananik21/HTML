    <h1>Coconut Growth</h1>
    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      The first stage in the growth of a coconut is seeding. A coconut seed is planted in fertile soil, preferably in a
      warm and tropical environment.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Sapling</h2>
    <p>
      After a few months, the coconut seed germinates and a sapling emerges from the soil. The sapling grows leaves and
      develops a strong root system.
    </p>


    <h2>Tree</h2>
    <p>
      As the sapling grows, it matures into a full-fledged coconut tree. The tree continues to produce leaves and grows
      taller and stronger.
    </p>

    <h2>Flowering</h2>
    <p>
      The coconut tree reaches a stage where it starts producing flowers. These flowers eventually develop into coconuts.
    </p>


    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <p>
      Once the coconuts have fully matured, they are ready for harvesting. They are carefully removed from the tree,
      either by climbing or using specialized tools.
